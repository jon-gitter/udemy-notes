The 7 primitive data types

1) Number: floating point numbers used for decimals and integers
    EX: let age = 23;

2) Strings: sequence of characters used for text
    EX: let firstName = 'Jonas';

3) Boolean: logical type that can only be ture or false used for taking decisions
    EX: let fullAge = true;

4) Undefined: value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value')
    EX: let children;

5) Null: also means 'empty value'

6) Symbol (ES2015): value that is unique and cannot be changed

7 BigInt (ES2020): larger integers than the Number type can hold


multiline comment: Can use /* at beginning then */ at end to comment out large chuncks of code

typeof operator: used on a value to show or be a new value, result will be a string with the type of value listed
    Ex: console.log(typeof true); --> boolean will be printed to the console log

Dynamic typing: easily change the type of a value that is held by a variable
    Ex: let javascriptIsFun = true; 
        javascriptIsFun = 'YES!';

        You only need to declare "let" once for a variable after that you just declare a new variable to change the value.
