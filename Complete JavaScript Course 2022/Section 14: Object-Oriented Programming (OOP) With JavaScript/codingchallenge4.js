/*
Your tasks:
1. Re-create Challenge #3, but this time using ES6 classes: create an 'EVCl'
child class of the 'CarCl' class
2. Make the 'charge' property private
3. Implement the ability to chain the 'accelerate' and 'chargeBattery'
methods of this class, and also update the 'brake' method in the 'CarCl'
class. Then experiment with chaining!
Test data:
ยง Data car 1: 'Rivian' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%

const rivian = new EVCl('Rivian', 120, 23);
console.log(rivian);
console.log(rivian.#charge); // this won't work, proves to us that it is truly private, it is encapsulated inside the class

// chaining methods
rivian
  .accelerate()
  .accelerate()
  .accelerate()
  .brake()
  .chargeBattery(50)
  .accelerate();

// showing that the child class also inherits the getters and setters from the parent class
console.log(rivian.speedUS); // will output 121.875 which is 195km/h converted to mph
